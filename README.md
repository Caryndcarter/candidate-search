## Description

This application was created in order to query the Github API and then to display and store Github users for a Human Resources team where a hiring manager would want to hire a developer off of Github.  On page load, you click yes or no on each developer to store them to the potential candidates list.  It was created using React, Vite, Node.js, TypeScript and the Github API.  The potential candidates are stored in local storage.
